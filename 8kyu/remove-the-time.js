// You're re-designing a blog, and the blog's posts have the Weekday Month Day, time format for showing the date and time when a post was made, e.g., Friday May 2, 7pm.

// You're running out of screen real estate, and on some pages you want to display a shorter format, Weekday Month Day that omits the time.

// Write a function that takes the website date/time in its original string format and returns the shortened format.

// Solution
const shortenToDate = (longDate) => longDate.split(",")[0]
console.log(shortenToDate("Tuesday January 29, 10pm"))
